## Objectives:

1. Get around 300 fake images downloaded from a library called This Person doesnt not Exist API
2. Find faces that might be duplicated
3. Face Recognition. 
4. Composite all face to generate one average face.

# Images

This section is about manipulating images. removing the faces from an image, removing any duplicate images, face recognition, combining all faces to form one average face, and animating this average face in real-time or recorded video.

### Download Fake Images
Compiste faces will be created by processing a series of photos, to obtain these photos, we will utilize a library called [This person does not exist API](https://pypi.org/project/thispersondoesnotexist/) to retrieve a large number of bogus images. Take the following actions:

1. create a folder inside the src folder name it fake Images.
   
```p
mkdir -p src/data/fakeImages
```

2. run file names getFakeFaces.py
   
```p
python faces/getFakeFaces.py  src/data/fakeImages 100
```
